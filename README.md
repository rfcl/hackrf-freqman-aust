# HackRF One FREQMAN Frequency Info for Australia (hackrf-freqman-aust)

This will be a general repository of Australia-specific frequency information in the FREQMAN TXT file format suitable for use in the HackRF One Portapack H2 (Mayhem).

So far this only includes:

- Australian UHF CB Frequencies (AU_CB_UHF.TXT)

To do:
- Australian ACMA Spectra DB (AU_ACMA_SPECTRA.TXT)
-> To include cross-referenced license, site, and device info, reminiscent of maprad.io DB but for use in HackRF.
